# Gatsby starter with Styled Components and linters

Gatsby starter with stylelint and eslint configs and using styled-components. Mainly for my personal projects.

## Includes:

* `GlobalStyle` component with a CSS reset
* `gatsby-plugin-react-svg` with a basic config to remove fixed dimensions
* `polished` for SASS-like functions in Styled Components,
* `gatsby-plugin-alias-imports` for import aliases like `@components`, `@pages` etc.
* polyfill for smooth JS scroll, until it's supported in Safari
* some basic breakpoints for RWD


## Quick-start 🏎:

1. ### Clone the repo 👯:

	```sh
	git clone git@github.com:kjhank/gatsby-styled-components.git
	```

2. ### Install everything

	```sh
	yarn install
	```

3. ### Start your development environment: 💻

	```sh
	cd gatsby-styled-components
	yarn dev
	```

	Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and view the basic layout.

4. ### Start coding! 👩‍💻

	Open any of the files in your favorite editor and see any changes you make as soon as you save the file.
